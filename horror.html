            <h2>1. The Thing (1982)</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Txjm94GnrPA?si=BuCes72Npo5xt5aq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>The Thing is the highest-rated horror movie on Letterboxd, a surprise, considering its initial chilly reception by critics and audiences. It infamously wasn't well received upon release, building up a steady audience in the years since. The Thing is now seen as an essential work of horror and science-fiction and one of John Carpenter's defining masterpieces.

                It's a paranoia-filled movie about a shape-shifting alien targeting a team of isolated researchers in Antarctica and what happens when they begin to realize they can no longer trust anyone else. The Thingis expertly crafted, genuinely suspenseful, and has some practical effects that still look incredible, ensuring it's deserving of being the top horror movie on Letterboxd.</p>

            <p><strong>Runtime:</strong> 1 hours 42 minutes</p>

            <h2>2. The Silence of the Lambs (1992)</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6iB21hsprAQ?si=uSwY6T-TRULDrqH5" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>Letterboxd sometimes changes genre tags for certain movies. As of recently, it's now marked The Silence of the Lambs as a horror movie. As such, it's instantly found itself ranking near the top of Letterboxd's highest-rated horror movies. Regardless of whether fans call it a horror movie or a crime/thriller film, one thing's for sure: The Silence of the Lambs is an absolute classic.

                It features arguably Anthony Hopkins's best performance and one of Jodie Foster's most celebrated roles. The former plays a dangerous imprisoned serial killer and cannibal who may be able to help the latter find another killer at large. The dynamic between the two makes for some fascinating and intense scenes, as does the slow build toward an unforgettable climax. The horror genre rarely gets as exciting or challenging as The Silence of the Lambs.</p>

            <h2>3. Psycho (1960)</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D90QhegiVvo?si=2w0lwX8cJlFF1s4U" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>It's not a controversial statement to say that Alfred Hitchcock revolutionized the horror genre in 1960 with the release of Psycho. There were plenty of noteworthy horror movies released before, and some even hold up to this date. However, few come close to Psycho's impact or its now-infamous ability to shock viewers who don't know what they're in for.

                Of course, the plot twists are quite well known nowadays, but it's still easy to appreciate Psycho for its brazenness and the way it tries to keep viewers on their toes as much as possible. It's also entertaining and stylish, and though it has some tough competition, it's easy to understand why it's considered one of Hitchcock's very best.</p>
            <p>Directed by Alfred Hitchcock</p>

            <h2>4. Alien (1979)</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sVwH0hIvV5k?si=cMX0tAayZj7cJqDZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>Its simple title befits its simple premise, but in no way can Alien be called "just" another straightforward horror movie. It takes a direct story about isolation and survival against a terrifying force in space and does all it can with it, making for a suspenseful and effectively nerve-wracking mix of sci-fi and horror.

                Since 1979, Alien has become a franchise, and though it has an excellent and action-packed sequel, the rest of the films have proven more divisive. Still, few would argue that the first isn't a classic horror film, and there's a good reason why it's considered one of the genre's definitive titles. Elevated by the stellar work of a brilliant cast, Alien is a thrilling survival horror story that cements space as the ultimate horror setting.</p>
            <p>Directed by Dan O'Bannon</p>

            <h2>5. The Shining (1980)</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZQvIJxG9Xs?si=qOXyX6b8GQoAL34B" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>What happens when one of the most acclaimed directors of all time tries his hand at making a horror movie, despite not being known for making horror movies, and succeeds? The best-case scenario is something like The Shining, a movie that came out in 1980 and still managed to be one of the year's highlights.

                It tells what sounds like it might be a clichéd story: a family goes to stay at a deserted hotel after the father gets a caretaking job during the off-season, only for everyone to become affected by the isolation and ghostly forces. By expertly blending psychological and supernatural horror, The Shining successfully becomes one of the all-time greats of the horror genre and tends to be beloved by everyone - well, except Stephen King.</p>
            <p>Directed by Stanley Kubrick</p>
            <p><strong>Runtime:</strong> 2 hours 26 minutes</p>

            <h2>9. Kwaidan (1964)</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XG5mvupo9Wc?si=1ngl26PE86T2C628" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>Few horror movies run for three hours, but Kwaidan just so happens to be a wholly unique example of the genre. It's an anthology film with a large scope and ambition, telling four different stories across its epic runtime, each approximately 40 to 50 minutes long. These stories are derived from Japanese folktales, making Kwaidan an early example of a great folk horror movie.

                As such, those who find the idea of a three-hour horror movie scarier than any of the horror contained within can rest assured - Kwaidan can be easily watched in as many as four different sittings. Kwaidan deservedly stands as one of the greatest Japanese horror movies of all time and puts several folk tales on screen with creative visuals and a bold sense of style.</p>
            <p>Directed by Masaki Kobayashi</p>
            <p><strong>Runtime:</strong> 3 hours 3 minutes</p>

            <h2>10. Demons (1971)</h2>
            <img src="https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/demons-1971.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5" alt="Movie Poster">
            <p>Of all the horror movies on Letterboxd that hold an average rating of 8/10 or higher, the Japanese film Demons is easily one of the most obscure and shouldn't be mixed up with the 1985 Italian possession horror movie of the same name. Demons is an engaging and effectively nightmarish movie that combines horror elements with samurai drama in a storyline that centers on a lone samurai, or ronin, seeking revenge after his money's stolen by a geisha.

                A particularly dark and brutal horror movie, Demons is an exercise in brutal and all-consuming revenge, with the ensuing violence impacting the entire cast for the worst. Demons can be a slow, challenging, and grisly viewing experience, but it's undeniably visceral and hard to shake once seen, making it hold up as an expertly made horror film.</p>
            <p>Directed by Toshio Matsumoto</p>
            <p><strong>Runtime:</strong> 2 hours 15 minutes</p> 
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8/10</p>
